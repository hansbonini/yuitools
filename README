********************************************************************************

This is a set of tools and documentation used to produce the English translation patch for Battle Golfer Yui.

********************************************************************************

Prebuilt Windows binaries are provided for the tools needed to build the translated ROM. To build the patched game, you will need a clean ROM image of Battle Golfer Yui (MD5 sum 8cfd0e5a169193cf9c66e6d237a45d77). Rename this ROM to "Battle Golfer Yui (J) [c][!].bin" and place it in the root folder of the project, then run build.bat. This should produce a new file, "Battle Golfer Yui (J) [c][!] (EN).bin", containing the translated ROM.

********************************************************************************

Source code and Visual Studio projects are provided for most contained tools. Some tools that were used only for dumping game resources are not included in the Visual Studio projects, but can easily be added if desired. libpng is required for some tools in the new_tools directory; prebuilt Windows libraries are provided for convenience.

It's also possible to build the tools in new_tools for Unix-like systems using the provided Makefiles.

If you need to build a new Atlas binary, you must use the modified version found in src/atlas_src_spacefix. This version disables Atlas' behavior of throwing away lines containing only ASCII spaces. The translation will not build correctly with the stock version of Atlas.
